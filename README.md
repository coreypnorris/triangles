##to_do

####This is a ruby method for determining the type of a triangle by it's sides.

To use it, download the zip file and navigate to the file in your terminal. Then run `ruby triangles_ui.rb` to bring up the user interface.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/parcels-triangles-to-do) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
